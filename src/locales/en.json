    "title": "About me",
    "description": "My name is Clément Charbonnel, I am 21 years old and a second-year engineering student at {ense3-link}. My studies focus on mechatronics, automation, and robotics. Outside of school, I am passionate about mechanics, DIY, computer science, and sports. Thanks to my passions, I love starting new {projects-link} to develop my skills and learn new things. But I always need a bit of tennis, rugby, or cycling to relax!",
